Software Engineering Project

Project Topic: Dental Clinic Management App
List of Team Members (5 students):
1.	Ania Keçi (Team Leader)
2.	Belita Hysaj
3.	Klea Lala
4.	Idi Xhengo
5.	Renis Garxenaj


Problem Identified:
An essential part of medical studies in any university is practical hours in which students apply their knowledge and prepare for future tasks. This approach is also followed in the field of dentistry, where students regularly treat and work with patients that have different needs. Students are constantly in a learning phase, so they need to document treatment plans, procedures, and different outcomes to assess their performance and improve their learning process. So, to summarize, a need arises for the proper management of patient records, treatment plans, and efficient appointments.


Solution Proposed:
A software for Dental Clinic Management, that is used for digital record-keeping and as a management system that allows the clinic to keep track of patient records, treatment plans, and appointments electronically.

Aim, Main Objectives and Description of the Application:
Aim: A user-friendly application that allows both experienced dentists and lecturers as well as the students to follow treatment plans and procedures effectively and efficiently.
Main Objectives: To provide a helpful tool that benefits the dental clinic and the dental students as well, helping the patients receive a better experience while improving the learning experience of students as well.
Description: This software will allow users depending on their status (as a student, patient, or other) to access features such as patients’ record management in which paperwork is reduced and patient records are added, edited, or deleted; appointment scheduling and reminders, in which appointments are scheduled, reminders are sent to patients and patient engagement is improved; communication tools that enable patient contact; a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate. These are only some of the initial ideas for the features of the application, as the more detailed and processed ones will be updated in the future.

Development Model

In general, our team has decided to adopt the Waterfall Model for the development of this software. Nonetheless, there are many times throughout the development process in which requirements may change or modifications have to be done for the system to provide a better experience. As a result of this, many aspects of Agile Development will be present as well. The main reasons for choosing the Waterfall Model are as follows:
Well-defined and clear planning: As the work for the project is organized in groups, it is essential to have milestones that are well-defined and easily understandable by all members. This can make project planning and the management of deadlines and timelines easier.
Documentation: As the experience of the team members with previous projects in the field of software development is limited, an emphasis on documentation guarantees that there is a better understanding of the requirements, design, and implementation as well during the process.
Linear development process: When applying the Waterfall Model, it is easier to understand what needs to be done and when. This also helps us determine if the tasks that are finished need improvement or changes when that process is finished.
Teamwork: When roles and responsibilities are made clear, the division of work within a team produces better results. In this case, each phase of the development process is completed before moving to the next one, and this allows each member to have a better view and understanding of their role.
Detection of issues early on: Since everything in the development process is performed in a step-by-step manner when problems arise it is easier to witness and improve them early on than to deal with delays or other similar issues.
Minimal involvement of the customer: Sometimes, it is not easy to maintain constant communication with the customer, so the requirements should be specified since the beginning together with the input and feedback during the requirements gathering phase.

Application Specifications

The Dental Clinic Management System application will be developed using web technologies such as PHP, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. That means that this application will be accessible through a web browser on desktop and mobile devices. 
The user interface is intended to be designed as a simple and easy interface to navigate, with a clean design. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be used to provide a responsive user experience. Within this application, patients will be able to book appointments with dental students and dentists, the application will also allow patients to upload and access dental records. 
A messaging system will also be a feature of the application, which will be made available to improve communication between both parties. The application will also provide a feedback system as a means to improve the quality of work and learning processes. As for some other technical aspects, this system will use PHP to handle user authentication and provide data security and it will also use HTTPS to encrypt data transmission between the device and server.
